# Massive Platformer

A massively multiplayer 2D side-scrolling platformer where hundreds of players appear as colored circles traversing a shared challenge map in real time. Built entirely on Cloudflare's infrastructure.

### How it works

1. **Player connects**: Browser creates a WebRTC PeerConnection to Cloudflare's Realtime SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit). No connection to the game server — just the SFU.

2. **Input flows up**: Player keyboard/touch input (1 byte) travels through an unreliable WebRTC data channel to the SFU, which forwards it to the bridge's subscription.

3. **Physics runs centrally**: The game server in the Cloudflare Container runs server-authoritative physics at 45hz — gravity, movement, platform collision for every player.

4. **State fans out at 15hz**: The bridge publishes delta-compressed state updates on a single data channel 15 times per second (with full snapshots every 3 seconds for loss recovery). The SFU's cascading tree architecture replicates each update to every connected player. The bridge sends one copy; the SFU handles thousands.

### Why this architecture

The core insight is **separating the data plane from the compute plane**.

Traditional multiplayer game servers handle both game logic AND network I/O. Every connected player is a socket the server must manage — read from, write to, keep alive. This creates a hard coupling between player count and server complexity. WebSocket servers top out at ~10K-50K connections per instance, and each connection consumes memory and CPU for I/O operations.

This architecture decouples them:

- **Compute** (the Container): Only runs game logic. Sees exactly one network connection — a single WebRTC PeerConnection to the SFU. Whether there are 10 or 10,000 players, the bridge sends the same 50 state packets per second on one connection.

- **Fanout** (the SFU): Handles all the per-player connections. Cloudflare's Realtime SFU is a globally distributed anycast WebRTC CDN. Each player connects to the nearest edge node. The SFU builds a cascading tree per data channel — the root node (nearest to the bridge) fans out to intermediate nodes, which fan out to edge nodes. Packet loss recovery (NACK) happens locally at each hop.

The game server doesn't know or care about individual player connections. It's just a physics engine with a single fat pipe.

### Cost structure

This is where it gets interesting. The architecture inverts the typical cost model.

**Traditional server**: You pay for compute proportional to connections. More players = more servers = more cost, even if most players are idle.

**This architecture**: Compute cost is nearly fixed (one container running physics). The variable cost is **data egress through the SFU** — and only for data that actually changes.

| Component | Cost driver | Scaling behavior |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Container | CPU time at 45hz | ~Fixed regardless of player count |
| SFU ingress | Bridge → SFU (1 stream) | Free (Cloudflare doesn't charge ingress) |
| SFU egress | SFU → all players | Linear with player count, but per-byte |
| Calls API | Session management | Only at join/leave, not during gameplay |

**The SFU egress is the only meaningful variable cost**, at $0.05/GB after 1TB free/month. And it's proportional to *data sent*, not connections held. Delta compression means stationary players cost zero egress.

#### Example: 500 concurrent players

| Item | Calculation | Monthly cost |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Container (lite) | 256MB, 1/16 vCPU, 24/7 | ~$7 |
| SFU egress | ~50 MB/s × 86400s × 30d | ~$6,500 |
| With delta compression | ~80% stationary at any time | ~$1,300 |
| With spatial culling | Send only ~50 nearby players | ~$130 |

The container is a rounding error. SFU egress dominates but responds directly to optimization — every byte you shave from the state packet multiplies across every player every tick.

#### Comparison to traditional hosting

A traditional game server at 500 players would need careful WebSocket management, likely multiple server instances with load balancing, sticky sessions, and state synchronization between instances. Cost: $50-200/month for compute, but engineering complexity is high.

This architecture: one container, one connection, linear egress cost, zero connection management. The SFU is a managed service — you don't operate it, scale it, or think about it.

## Binary protocol

### Input (player → server): 1 byte
```
Bit 0: left
Bit 1: right
Bit 2: jump
```
Only sent when input state changes. 1 byte per input event.

### State (server → all players): delta-compressed

```
[type:u8] [count:u16] [..players]

type 0 = full snapshot (all players, sent every 3 seconds)
type 1 = delta (only changed players since last broadcast)

Per player entry (11 bytes):
  [id:u16] [x:f32] [y:f32] [flags:u8]

flags:
  bit 0 = grounded
  bit 1 = removed (player disconnected)
```

Physics runs at 45hz server-side (3x the network rate). Network broadcasts are decoupled at 15hz — exactly one broadcast every 3 physics ticks. Full snapshots every 3 seconds ensure clients recover from packet loss. Delta ticks only include players whose position changed by more than 0.3px since last broadcast. Stationary players cost zero bandwidth between snapshots.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+
- Docker
- Wrangler CLI (`npm install -g wrangler`)
- A Cloudflare account with Workers Paid plan
- A Cloudflare Calls app (create at [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/calls))

### Configuration

Set your Calls app credentials in `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
[vars]
CALLS_APP_ID = "your-app-id"
CALLS_APP_TOKEN = "your-app-token"
```

### Local development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd container && npm install && cd ..

# Run the game server locally
cd container
CALLS_APP_ID="..." CALLS_APP_TOKEN="..." node src/server.js
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

### Deploy to Cloudflare

```bash
# Full deploy (builds container, pushes to registry, deploys Worker)
./deploy.sh

# Deploy only Worker + static assets (skip container rebuild)
./deploy.sh --skip-container
```

The deploy script handles the full pipeline:
1. Builds the container image with `--no-cache` (wrangler's Docker cache is aggressive and often serves stale images)
2. Pushes to Cloudflare's container registry
3. Updates `wrangler.toml` with the new image tag
4. Bumps the DO instance name (container DOs are sticky to old images — changing the name forces a fresh instance)
5. Runs `wrangler deploy`
6. Restores `wrangler.toml` to use the Dockerfile path for git cleanliness

## Key technical discoveries

**Cloudflare Calls API quirks:**
- `/sessions/new` without a body creates a session; with `sessionDescription` it creates + exchanges SDP in one call
- `/datachannels/establish` does not work — use `/sessions/new` with SDP or `/tracks/new` with `autoDiscover: true`
- Subscribe + `createDataChannel({negotiated: true})` must happen atomically in the same microtask, or the subscription stays inactive

**Cloudflare Containers:**
- Run on Firecracker microVMs — full Linux kernel, native addons work
- UDP outbound works (confirmed: WebRTC connects from container to SFU)
- Environment variables must be set via `this.envVars =` in the Container class constructor
- DO names are sticky to container instances — change the name to force a fresh instance after image updates
